# Task 4: AR/VR Interface Design

## Concept Overview
- **Experience Name**: Virtual Reality Experience Selector  
- **Platform**: Mobile AR/VR app  
- **Goal**: Let users smoothly start an AR experience, browse an object library, and learn how to use AR/VR through a clean, futuristic interface.

## Figma Prototype
- **Figma File**: [View the AR/VR UI in Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/3HFfrVsYKLF2oYXeufy8kq/Codtech-Projects?node-id=1-3&t=GPRkc12B0Et0w6X2-1)
- The prototype includes the style guide, welcome screen, main menu, and surface detection screen.

## Use Case & Flow
1. User opens the app and lands on a **welcome screen** with clear options: “Start AR Experience”, “Object Library”, and “Learn AR/VR”.  
2. On selecting **Start AR Experience**, the user is guided to move the phone to detect a surface.  
3. Once a surface is detected, virtual content can be placed and interacted with. [attached_file:1]

## Visual Design Choices
- **Typography**: Used the **Aldrich** font to create a sci‑fi, tech-forward feel that matches VR.  
- **Color Palette**:  
  - Primary accent: `#FF9F3F`  
  - Background: `#01010B`  
  - Secondary accent: `#FFB96E`  
  This high-contrast palette makes key actions stand out against the dark environment, supporting readability and immersion. [attached_file:1]

## Screens (Images)

These images are exported directly from the Figma file and show the main steps of the AR/VR experience. 

## Interaction & UX Decisions
- **Clear CTAs**: Large, rounded buttons for the three main actions so users know exactly where to start.  
- **Guided Scanning**: Instruction screen “Move your phone to detect a surface” reduces confusion during AR setup.  
- **Focus on Intuition**: Minimal text, strong hierarchy, and clear feedback states help new users understand what to do next without tutorials. 
- **Mobile-first Layout**: Tall card layout optimized for one-hand use, with primary actions placed within thumb reach.
